A wise man once said:
You ain't a developer if you haven't created a ToDo App so far.

Create a Todo:
title [mandatory],

description, dueDate, priority, checklist = {}, notes: "", [optional]

Create a project class:
+ it takes as many todos as possible
+ it has a name

+ it takes further todos.
+ each is either ordered by
    + title
    + dueDate
    + priority
+ it can remove todos

What can I do with todos:
+ I can create a new one
+ I can delete the current one
+ I can edit them
+ I can move them to a project
+ I can move them out of a project
+ I can see the progress bar, also based on subtasks
+ it has a tasks done bar

What can I do with projects:
+ I can create them
+ I can edit them
+ I can complete the project.
+ I can see the progress based on completed tasks

What should a manager be able to do:
+ take the user information and put them in a task object
+ able to know how many tasks exist
+ able to know how many of them are
